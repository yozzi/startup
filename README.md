StartUp
===

Hurray. I'm a WordPress plugin called `StartUp`. My goal is to simplify WordPress backend to suit customer's need.

What I do:

* Add a beautiful login screen with full background slideshow
* Clean GUI things up by hiding some features and informations
* Remove dashboard
* Add a Wall page with user profile details (work in progress for future use)
* Change logo for StartUp logo, although I don't hide WordPress existence
* Remove de Howdy Message
* Add link to yozz.net
* Change footer text
* Hide WordPress update notices for non-admins
* Add a Help page
* Add a Blog shortcode with Shortcake support
* Add a post ID column
* A lot of other things and more to come

Plugin designed to work with [StartUp Reloaded](https://github.com/yozzi/startup-reloaded) WordPress theme.
