StartUp
===

Hurray. I'm a WordPress plugin called `StartUp`. My goal is to simplify WordPress backend to suit customer's need.

What I do:

* Add a beautiful login screen with full background slideshow
* Clean gui things up by hiding some features
* Change logo for StartUp logo, although I don't hide WordPress existence
* A lot of other things to come

Plugin designed to work with [StartUp Reloaded](https://github.com/yozzi/startup-reloaded) WordPress theme.
